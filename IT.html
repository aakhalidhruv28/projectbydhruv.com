<font face="Arial black" color="#006600" size="7">What is Information Technology ?</font>
<p><h3><font face="Swis721 lt BT">
Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.<br>
<br>
The Harvard Business Review coined the term information technology to make a distinction between purpose-built machines designed to perform a limited scope of functions, and general-purpose computing machines that could be programmed for various tasks. As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability increased, while device cost and energy consumption decreased, a cycle that continues today when new technologies emerge.

<p><h3>
<font face="cooper black" size="5">The IT department ensures that the organization's systems, networks, data and applications all connect and function properly. The IT team handles three major areas:</font><br>
<br><img src="photos/it logo2.png" align="right" height="130px" border="5" style="border-radius:50px">
<font face="Swis721 lt BT">
  <font color="blue" size="6">1.</font> Deploys and maintains business applications, services and infrastructure (servers, networks, storage),<br>
  <font color="blue" size="6">2.</font> Monitors, Optimizes and troubleshoots the performance of applications, services and infrastructure, and<br>
  <font color="blue" size="6">3.</font> Oversees the security and governance of applications, services and infrastructure.<br>
</font>
<br>
<font face="cooper black" size="5">Most IT staff have different responsibilities within the team that break into several key areas including:</font><br>
<br>
<font color="blue" size="5">♦</font> <font size="6">Administration:</font><br><font face="Swis721 lt BT"> Handle the day-to-day deployment, operation and monitoring of an IT environment, including systems, networks and applications. Admins often perform a range of other duties such as software upgrades, user training, software license management, procurement, security, data management and observing adherence to business process and compliance requirements.</font><br><br>

<font color="blue" size="5">♦</font> <font size="6">Support:</font><br><font face="Swis721 lt BT"> Help desk staff specialize in answering questions, gathering information and directing troubleshooting efforts for hardware and software. IT support often includes IT asset and change management, helping admins with procurement, handling backup and recovery of data and applications, monitoring and analyzing logs and other performance monitoring tools and following established support workflows and processes.</font><br><br>

<font color="blue" size="5">♦</font> <font size="6">Applications:</font><br><font face="Swis721 lt BT">Businesses rely on software to perform work. Some applications are procured and deployed from third parties, such as email server applications. But many organizations retain a staff of skilled developers that create the applications and interfaces such as APIs needed to deliver critical business capabilities and services. Applications might be coded in a wide array of popular languages and integrated with other applications to create smooth and seamless interactions between different applications. Developers might also be tasked with creating interactive business websites and building mobile applications. The trend toward agile or continuous development paradigms require developers to be increasingly involved with IT operations, such as deploying and monitoring applications.</font><br><br>

<font color="blue" size="5">♦</font> <font size="6">Compliance:</font><br><font face="Swis721 lt BT">Businesses are obligated to observe varied government- and industry-driven regulatory requirements. IT staff play a major role in securing and monitoring access to business data and applications to ensure that such resources are used according to established business governance policy that meets regulatory requirements. Such staff are deeply involved with security tasks and routinely interact with legal and business teams to prevent, detect, investigate and report possible breaches.</font><br>
</h3></p>

<font face="Arial Black" color="#006600" size="7">Why is Information Technology Important ?</font>

<p><h3><font face="swis721 lt bt">
It's been said that data is what powers industries worldwide. That may be hyperbole, but few businesses large or small can remain competitive without the ability to collect data and turn it into useful information. IT provides the means to develop, process, analyze, exchange, store and secure information.<br><br>

Computing has penetrated practically every part of business and much of our personal lives. The ubiquity of computing also referred to as pervasive computing is another reason why IT is critical. Computing devices have evolved well beyond personal computers and servers. Today, all businesses and most individuals have and use multiple computing devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, game consoles and even doorbells, thermostats, vacuums and many kitchen appliances.<br><br>

Virtually all these devices, many of which are part of the IoT, tap into the internet, which interconnects billions of devices worldwide. It's a complex and, potentially, perilous environment that requires IT expertise for management, security, maintenance and reliability.

<font face="Arial Black" color="#006600" size="7">Examples of Information Technology :</font>

<p><h3>
<font face="cooper" size="5">So how is IT actually involved in day-to-day business? Consider five common examples of IT and teams at work:</font><br><br>
<br>
<font size="6" color="blue">1.</font><font size="6"> Server Upgrade:</font><br>
 <font face="swis721 lt bt">One or more data center servers near the end of their operational and maintenance lifecycle. IT staff will select and procure replacement servers, configure and deploy the new servers, backup applications and data on existing servers, transfer that data and applications to the new servers, validate that the new servers are working properly and then repurpose or decommission and dispose of the old servers.</font><br><br>
<font size="6" color="blue">2.</font><font size="6"> Security Monitoring:</font><br>
<font face="swis721 lt bt">Businesses routinely employ tools to monitor and log activity in applications, networks and system IT staff receive alerts of potential threats or noncompliant behavior -- such as a user attempting to access a restricted file -- check logs and other reporting tools to investigate and determine the root cause of the alert and take prompt action to address and remediate the threat, often driving changes and improvements to security posture that can prevent similar events in the future.</font><br><br>
<font size="6" color="blue">3.</font><font size="6"> New software:</font><br>
<font face="swis721 lt bt">The business determines a need for a new mobile application that can allow customers to log in and access account information or conduct other transactions from smartphones and tablets. Developers work to create and refine a suitable application according to a planned roadmap. Operations staff posts each iteration of the new mobile application for download and deploy the back-end components of the app to the organization's infrastructure.</font><br><br>
<font size="6" color="blue">4.</font><font size="6"> Business improvement:</font><br>
<font face="swis721 lt bt"> A business requires more availability from a critical application to help with revenue or business continuance strategies. The IT staff might be called upon to architect a high-availability cluster to provide greater performance and resilience for the application to ensure that the application can continue to function in the face of single outages. This can be paired with enhancements to data storage protection and recovery.</font><br><br>
<font size="6" color="blue">5.</font><font size="6"> User support:</font><br>
<font face="swis721 lt bt">Developers are building a major upgrade for a vital business application. Developers and admins will collaborate to create new documentation for the upgrade. IT staff might deploy the upgrade for limited beta testing -- allowing a select group of users to try the new version -- while also developing and delivering comprehensive training that prepares all users for the new version's eventual release.</font><br>
